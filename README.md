# Lab

Personal lab to play around with algorithms and data.

**NOTE:** In order to make the implementations as understandable as possible I sometimes write more expressive code which could result in poor performance or disapproval of purists. I strongly believe that readability for such educational endeavors is more important than high-performance or idiomatic code.

## Running it

**NOTE:** You can pass an optional port number as the first CLI argument (i.e. `./jupyter-lab 3000`).

### Jupyter Lab

```sh
./jupyter-lab.sh
```

### Jupyter Notebook

```sh
./jupyter-notebook.sh
```
