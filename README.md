# Lab

Personal Lab to play around with data and algorithms.

**NOTE:** In order to make the implementations as understandable as possible I sometimes write more expressive code which could result in poor performance or disapproval of purists. I strongly believe that readability for such educational endeavors is more important than high-performance or idiomatic code.

## Running it

Just run the different shell scripts prefixed with `drun-` (e.g. `./drun-deepo`).
